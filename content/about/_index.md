And finally, I´ve managed to get a HUGO site running, **there is a true merit**. 

Here will put some history about me, when I have some time to do so. Firs, a very identificative picture of me:

![This is me][1]

I'm a great fan of music, physics, religion and also had to work as a Network Engineer:

Most of the relevant information is in my [Linkedin Profile][3], but I can summarize:

```I´m used, since I started university, to fix unconventional problems in everyday environments. I had to built up from scratch a complete data processing infrastructure to do the data analysis for my PhD thesis, in a domestic environment, where nothing of that was previously built. It was a huge work, but allowed me to get in touch with new technologies from the big labs (CERN, DESY), specially a weird one called hypertext and world wide web... I know that work on unknown environments is hard, but this gave me useful and first hand experience on things that would do history later. And I´ve doing it my whole life, so that´s fine```


#### Education

Not really a fan of certifications, but somewhat the only way some people could recognize your value, wherever it is...

Also had some time to take photos, and they are here:
