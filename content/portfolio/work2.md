These are my favourite online tools.  I hope that you like it!

## Tracemon
This access to the tool: [My TraceMON][1] 

And this is where it comes from:  [About TraceMON][2]

## ASCII diagrams online
It used to be [ASCIIflow Infinity][3], but [THIS TexTik][4] is also quite good 

## Online network diagrams drawing

First and always, A. Yourtchenko tool: [YOURTCHENKO][5] and his [Offline Copy][6]
And some others:

* [LucidChart][7]
* [CREATELY][8]
* [draw.io][9]
* This is not online, but maybe worthy: [Network Notepad][10]

## Welcome Function
Here is a little Python function to welcome you:

{{< highlight python >}}
def hello_world():
    print "Hello there!"
{{< /highlight >}}
