And finally, IÂ´ve managed to get a HUGO site running, **there is a true merit**. 

Here will put some history about me, when I have some time to do so. Firs, a very identificative picture of me:

I'm a great fan of music, physics, religion and also had to work as a Network Engineer:

#### Education

* PhD in Theoretical Physics, Apto Cum Laude (1988)
* Cisco CCNA (2002)
* Hurricane Electric IPv6 Sage (2010)
* Juniper JNCIP-ENT (2014)
* Juniper JNCIS-SP (2016)

Not really a fan of certifications, but somewhat the only way some people could recognize your value, wherever it is...

Also had some time to take photos, and they are here:
